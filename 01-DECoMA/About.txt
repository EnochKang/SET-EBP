DECoMA is the abbreviation for Data Estimation and Conversion for Meta-Analysis, which is a free available Microsoft Office Excel file with Excel-macros for estimating sample mean and standard deviation (SD). 
It is developed by methodology team members in the Cochrane Taiwan and Wan Fang Hospital. 
Current version consists of 10 common circustances with solutions for finding mean or SD for meta-analysis. 
First five circustances can be used when you have descriptive statistics of a research group. 
Rest five circustances can be used when you have effect estimates with other statistics of two group comparison. 

To confirm the appropriateness of the senarios and formula, task force of the DECoMA have sent it for external review by an academic journal (accepted).
